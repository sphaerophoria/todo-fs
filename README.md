# todo-fs

A file system to organize my life

## The pitch

* I have files on my disk containing notes about stuff I wanna do
* Sometimes things have to happen before other things, or are related to other things, or have some other relationship with other things
* I want to link them together
* Links are bi-directional. Maintaining symlinks from a -> b and b -> a by hand is a pita
* New filesystem!
